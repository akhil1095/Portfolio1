                            <p>A computer Programmer with a strong technical background. I graduated from my highschool diploma in 2014 and then worked for family business as a data entry analyst and then moved to canada in september. I started working for a company "Cellicon" as a mobile phone technician. Then i did my first Co-op workterm with the same company in Vaughan. I had a great experience working as a Technical Support Specialist where i had to handle the customers, providing them resolutions to the services provided to them in a most proffessional way. I improved my communication skills and interpersonal skills there.</p>
                            <p>I really enjoyed working with the comapany as the work environment was really friendly and casual. My second Co-up was in saskachewan in winters 2016. It was very unique experience working there as the place was totally different and had to figure out stuff again. There i learned to make schedules, Inventory Lists. I worked there until April 2016. Currently, looking forward for third Co-op term working in the technical support field which is where i am good.</p>
